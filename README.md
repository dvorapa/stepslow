Simple music player for dancers

## Description
This app allows dancers to play their dance music collection in a simple,
yet feature-rich artistic environment also in Android. Currently it can handle
just basic features like playing audio files from your phone/SD card storage,
but already includes slow down/speed up option as well. In future releases
you can look forward to a YouTube player containing improved slow down/speed up
option inside the app, as well as creating playlists, or stripping a song
of a prelude/extending a song by a prelude (not-only Paso Doble dancers should
know what I'm talking about, right?).

## Usage
Soon enough this app will be available in Google Play store and others. Anyway,
you can always compile the app for yourself using steps
in [Flutter compile guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android).
