# Stepslow Music Player

Simple Music Player for Dancers

## Description

This app allows dancers to play their collection of dance music in a simple,
yet feature-rich artistic environment on Android. Currently, it not only
handles basic functionality, such as playing audio files from a phone/memory
card storage, but also includes the ability to slow down/speed up songs,
as well as shorten songs to the same length or delay playback of a song by
a specified time (not-only Paso Doble dancers should know what I'm
talking about, right?). In future releases, you can look forward to creating
playlists of songs, a YouTube player with improved slow down/speed up option
inside the app and two separate players next to each other.

## Usage

Currently you can obtain this app from [Google Play](
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.dvorapa.stepslow). You
might want to subscribe to its alpha/beta channels there. Nevertheless still
you can compile the app for yourself using steps in [Flutter compile guide](
https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android) if you wish.
