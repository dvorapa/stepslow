Simple music player for dancers

## Description

This app allows dancers to play their collection of dance music in a simple,
yet feature-rich artistic environment also on Android. Currently, it not only
handles basic functionality, such as playing audio files from a phone/SD card
storage, but also includes the ability to slow down/speed up songs, as well as
shorten songs to the same length or extend songs by prelude (not-only
Paso Doble dancers should know what I'm talking about, right?). In future
releases, you can look forward to creating playlists of your favourite songs,
or a YouTube player with improved slow down/speed up option inside the app.

## Usage

Currently you can obtain this app from [Google Play](
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.dvorapa.stepslow). You
might want to subscribe to its beta channel there. Nevertheless still you can
compile the app for yourself using steps in [Flutter compile guide](
https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android) if you wish.
